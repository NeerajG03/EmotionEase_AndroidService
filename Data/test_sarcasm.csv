"Nice try, but no cigar. I never said that inflation had no effect. Of course it does. But even factoring in the alleged 500% inflation since the 1960s or whatever it happens to be depending on calculation does not account for the huge run-up in the price of crude to nearly $80 not that long ago.

Again, this was refined by natural selection over time. In the end, the newly-evolved system was irreducibly complex, because all three parts have to be present for the system to work.

"I'm going to assume you misunderstood my post because I don't think you are an idiot...so giving you the benefit of the doubt let me retrace the series of events.
Matthew S. Stated that when people say ""We believe marriage is between a man and a woman."" think that gays are not citizens. I then returned a question saying ""if someone if 6 and can't marry are they going to 'not be citizens' as well?"". The logic behind that question is not to say that gays are 6 year olds but rather that gays are citizens just like a 6 yr old even if both can't marry. In other words, marriage doesn't make you a citizen or not...unless you think 6yr olds are citizens as well. Trying to make it seem like I made a statement out of a question is foolish and should be avoided.",sarcasm

Well, 40 years went by, and new officers seeing this law on the books started enforcing it. After all, why not, It is the law, and their is no excuse for the law! Period!   Well, Ohioans for Concealed Carry and a bunch of others, decided enough was enough, and contacted Ohio law makers who took it off the books because it wasn't being used, as agreed upon!",not_sarcasm

The left supports rights while your side want to limit the rights of others.You want to stop me from being able to marry because you have a religious belief against it even though I may have a religious belief that supports it.

"Part of the problem with the abortion issue goes with our perception of the value of animal life in general. We see a fly and swat it. We see a rat and set a dog on it. We see a cockroach and stamp on it. Pests. No problem. But when elephants trample villages, or other warm-blooded mammals become pests, there's an outcry about the destruction method. We don't see giant sledgehammers swatting elephants! - practicalities aside. Destruction has to be humane. And when it suits our purposes. It seems that cuddly, warm-blooded, embryo look-alikes get more emotional feeling than flies, cockroaches, mosquitos et al.   From a strictly 'argument' point of view, emotion shouldn't enter the picture. If pro-lifers/anti-abortionists looked at the issue dispassionately and rationally (difficult, I know), then they may well end up with a different viewpoint.   How do we take the emotion out of argument?",not_sarcasm

It is generally true that no organ ever springs into existance completely developed where nothing existed before. The wings of bats, birds, and pterodactyls are merely the modified fore-limb of a tetrapod. There is evidence that insect wings may have arisen from some sort of thermal panel. And of course, size has considerable relevance to flight. Wingless spiders fly by spinning a loop of silk that is carried by the moving air. Very small insects require almost no wings to fly. What they do is more similar to a whale in water than a bird in air. If by chance, a small animal is upsized because of a competetive advantage, and the wings are too, then it becomes a larger flying animal.",not_sarcasm

The environment has been shown to have effects on DNA, i.e., the genome of the population.",not_sarcasm

"I believe that's true, and as a ""believer"" (creationist), here is what is hard to understand about that; In Matthew, 12:30, Jesus says ""He who is not with me is against me, and he who does not gather with me scatters"". It is safe to say that both creationists and theistic evolutionists would accept that statement from Jesus, and would seek to be ""with"" him, while agnostic and atheists would consider themselves ""not with"" him. Yet theistic evolutionists are comfortable to (usually politically) be ""with"" agnostics and atheists, and separate themselves from creationists. If they're genuine Christians, knowing about the warnings in the Bible about false teachings, how can they be comfortable with that?Miller laments in several places throughout the book that atheists use evolution as a weapon against religion, and that it shouldn't be that way - that it causes more strife between the two than should exist.

What I'm saying is that in every place where our alleged primate ancestors fossils have been found, so haven't the fossils of animals described as lower primates been found.

"Yes. It describes an action without ascribing its form to its end result, outcome, whatever but strictly to a cause/s force/s in action. That is why 'selection' is always teleological. In order to select or choose anything, an end must always be in view. There must always be a volitional discrimination of options based upon a criterion dictated by the desired end. The only time ""channel"" becomes teleological is when something live [a human or a beaver, let's say] intententionally does the channeling. But since it is understood that mechanical forces can also 'channel', unintentional, out of simple mechanics, the word channel cannot be called teleological. In the same way, 'sorting' can be considered non-teleological, hence mechanical, and thus suited to your glossary, because things can be sorted by mechanical forces alone. But 'selection' always requires volition and awareness. So 'selection' is always teleological.",not_sarcasm

The right to murder, for example. I do not believe in the tyranny of the majority; I believe in the majority's right to legitimately wield its power. If we are not going to be governed by majority rule, then what will we be governed by? If not rule by the many, do you propose we be ruled by the few? Would you really be happy to live under a dictator?   Because self-government loses its meaning totally if the people are prohibited from amending their constitution by persons other than themselves.

My belief on this is that every time someone calls for repeal of gun control laws or opposes the new gun control laws, it fuels the anti-gun extremists to call for the total ban on all guns. If we cannot make and enforce common sense gun control laws that both sides can agree on, neither side will ever stop. If a buy back was ever proposed in America, very few guns would be sold. If guns were banned all together, only the law abiding people will give up their guns, and anyone who does not will unfortunately become a criminal.",not_sarcasm

Brains cluster nerves so that appropriate action can be taken. Some brains are amazingly simple while others like our own are immensly complex.

And here's another flash, socrates. The fact that some organisms die, for any number of reasons, sooner than some of their relatives do, explains exactly nothing. The insinuation that this survival differential has some universal, as opposed to local, efficient cause, is pure fecal matter. And that's all you've got, wiseguy. A simple fact of life, and an insinuated cause, and you think they add up to evolution. Breathtakingly simple-minded assumption, fella.

You just made another gaps argument making the assumption that if theory X does not explain observation Y that a theory which is untested and untestable MUST be the only alternative explanation. Balderdash and shame on you. The alternative theories would likely be numerous and the ONLY one is not something untested and untestable.But I forgive you GOD probably made you make the error for his own mysterious reasons.

It is a hedonistic culture and often the lifestyle and recreational drug use go hand in hand.'""

"Well, it happens in virtually every thread.Some disagreements are between individuals of essentially the same basic system [Protestant Christian vs Protestant Christian], [atheist rationalist vs atheist rationalist]. Many disagreements are between individual of differing belief systems. In such cases the individuals often use the same word to mean two different things.What is evidence? Well, that will depend on your core belief system. Sacred writings may be excellent evidence for your belief system, but when you say the Qu'ran proves an issue, the Christian says Thats not evidence!.One side tries to convince the other side that their core beliefs are incorrect, so they really have no evidence for their position.",not_sarcasm
